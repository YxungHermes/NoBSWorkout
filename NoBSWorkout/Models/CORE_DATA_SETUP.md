# Core Data Setup Instructions

This project uses Core Data with **automatic code generation**. The entity classes are automatically generated by Xcode and do not need to be committed to the repository.

## Setting Up Core Data Auto-Generation

When you set up the Xcode project, you need to configure the Core Data model to auto-generate entity classes.

### Step 1: Open the Data Model

1. In Xcode, open `NoBSWorkout/Models/NoBSWorkout.xcdatamodeld`
2. You'll see 4 entities in the left panel

### Step 2: Configure Each Entity

For **each entity** (`ExerciseTemplate`, `PersonalRecord`, `SetEntry`, `WorkoutSession`):

1. **Select the entity** in the left panel
2. Open the **Data Model Inspector** (right sidebar, ⌥⌘4)
3. Find the **"Codegen"** dropdown
4. Set it to **"Class Definition"**

This tells Xcode to automatically generate both the class and properties files for each entity.

### Step 3: Build the Project

Once configured, Xcode will automatically generate the entity classes during build. These files are created in `DerivedData` and are **not** checked into source control.

## Codegen Options Explained

- **Manual/None**: You write the entity classes yourself (not recommended for this project)
- **Class Definition**: Xcode auto-generates both `EntityName+CoreDataClass.swift` and `EntityName+CoreDataProperties.swift` ✅ **Use this**
- **Category/Extension**: Xcode generates only properties, you write the class (for advanced customization)

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find type 'WorkoutSession' in scope"

This error means the entity classes aren't being generated. Check:

1. The `.xcdatamodeld` file is added to your target
2. Each entity's Codegen is set to "Class Definition"
3. You've built the project at least once (`⌘B`)
4. Clean build folder (`⇧⌘K`) and rebuild

### Multiple Definition Errors

This means you have both manual entity files AND auto-generation enabled:

1. Remove any manual `*+CoreDataClass.swift` and `*+CoreDataProperties.swift` files
2. Clean build folder
3. Rebuild

## Why Auto-Generation?

Auto-generating Core Data entity classes has several advantages:

- ✅ **No manual maintenance** - Xcode updates classes when you modify the data model
- ✅ **No merge conflicts** - Generated files aren't in source control
- ✅ **Always in sync** - Classes always match your data model
- ✅ **Less code** - No need to manually write boilerplate

## Data Model Schema

See `CoreDataSchema.md` in this directory for detailed documentation of the data model structure, entities, attributes, and relationships.
